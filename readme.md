PHP JobQueue component
======================

Simple Job/Queue PHP composent to help applications distribute Tasks through
multiple workers.

JobQueue enables to follow Tasks progress.

Currently only Redis has been integrated to store Tasks.

Vocabulary:

  * **Job** define the work

  * **Task** register all options and params to run Jobs, set profile, and
    track progress

  * **Queue** store and manage Tasks, provide Tasks for Workers

  * **Worker** takes Tasks from Queue to setup Jobs and execute them

  * **profile** affected to Tasks, Workers are then set up to only take Tasks
    having certain profiles

  * **status** a Task may have one of the following profiles:
    - `pending`  not in Queue yet
    - `waiting`  in Queue
    - `running`  currently setting up a Job that is executed
    - `success`  successfuly executed, may still have children not yet treated
    - `failed`   an error prevented the Job from being executed
    - `finished` out of Queue, successfuly treated, not more waiting children

Install
-------

Use composer to install the composent dependancies :

	cd /path/to/composent
	composer install


Write a Job
-----------

Jobs are simple class that must extend the `AbstractJob` parent class.

Jobs must implement the `JobInterface`. Therefore, a `perform()` method must
be written with the main Job work to be executed by workers. This method must
return `true` otherwise worker will consider the Job execution as failed.

Jobs may be setup through a `setup()` method that must return `true` if used.
If some stuff need to be done after the main work, a `terminate()` methode can
be used and must also return `true` if used.

See example/Job to view a Job example.

Useful methods:

  * `$this->hasParameter($name)`            check if a parameter exists

  * `$this->getParameter($name, $default)`  retrieve a parameter by its name

  * `$this->setTaskProgress($float)`        to track Job progress while running


Add Tasks to Queue
------------------

Here is an example of how you create and add Tasks to Queue (you can also look
at the `task:import` command):

```php
<?php

require '/path/to/vendor/autoload.php';

use Libcast\JobQueue\Task;
use Libcast\JobQueue\Queue\QueueFactory;
use Libcast\JobQueue\TestJob\DummyJob;
use Predis\Client;

$task = new Task(
    'a-dummy-task-name',
    'dummy',
    new DummyJob,
    [
        'param1' => 'foo',
        'param2' => 'bar',
    ]
);

// setup a Redis client
$redis = new Client('tcp://localhost:6379');

// load Queue
$queue = QueueFactory::build($redis);

// add Tasks to the Queue
$queue->enqueue($task);
```


Nested Tasks
------------

A Task can have children. Children are enqueued when their parents have been
executed successfully by the Worker. To add a Task as a child of a parent Task,
you may proceed like in the example above :

```php
$task = new Task(/* ... */);
$child = new Task(/* ... */);

$task->addChild($child);
```

A Task reach 100% progress when all its children have been finished too.


Get Task progress
-----------------

To get the Task progress you simply can call `getProgress()` from a Queue object.

```php
// setup a Redis client
$redis = new Client('tcp://localhost:6379');

// load Queue
$queue = QueueFactory::build($redis);

// get Task progress
$queue->getProgress(123); // where 123 is a Task ID
```


CLI

### Synopsis

    queue
      queue:show        List jobs from the queue
      queue:flush       Flush the queue
      queue:recover     Move all buggy Tasks to the `waiting` list
    task
      task:add          Add a Task
      task:delete       Delete a Task
      task:edit         Edit a Task
    worker
      worker:run        Run a worker

A typical command would look like:

    bin/jobqueue queue:show example/config.php
    bin/jobqueue worker:run profile example/config.php
